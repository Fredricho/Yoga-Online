                <h2>ashtanga</h2>
                <p>Ashtanga Yoga is a traditional style of yoga that was developed by Sri K. Pattabhi Jois in the
                    20th century. The practice is characterized by a specific sequence of postures, or asanas, that are
                    performed in a particular order, with a focus on breath and movement.<br><br>
                    The Ashtanga Yoga sequence consists of six series of asanas, each with its own set of postures
                    and variations. The practice is typically done to promote sweating and detoxification, and
                    practitioners are encouraged to move at their own pace, while synchronizing their breath with each
                    movement.<br><br>Ashtanga Yoga is often described as a physically demanding and rigorous practice,
                    as it requires
                    a great deal of strength, flexibility, and stamina. The primary series, also known as Yoga
                    Chikitsa, or yoga therapy, focuses on building a strong foundation of postures and alignment, while
                    the
                    later series introduce more challenging postures and transitions.</p>

                <h2>Hatha</h2>
                <p>Hatha Yoga is a traditional style of yoga that is characterized by a focus on physical
                    postures, breathing techniques, and meditation. The word "hatha" is derived from the Sanskrit words
                    "ha" meaning sun and "tha" meaning moon, symbolizing the balance and union of opposing.<br><br>
                    In Hatha Yoga, the emphasis is on balancing the body and mind through physical practice. The
                    practice often begins with warm-up movements and breathing exercises, followed by a sequence
                    of postures, or asanas, that are held for a period of time. These postures can range from
                    gentle stretches to more challenging inversions and balances.<br><br> Overall, Hatha Yoga is a
                    versatile and accessible practice that can offer a range of physical and mental benefits. Whether
                    you're looking to increase flexibility, reduce stress, or deepen your connection with your body and
                    breath, Hatha Yoga can be a great way to enhance your overall health and well-being.</p>

                <p>Yin Yoga is a slow-paced, meditative style of yoga that involves holding passive
                    stretches for several minutes at a time. Unlike more active styles of yoga that focus on building
                    strength and flexibility through movement and flow, Yin Yoga is designed to target the deeper
                    connective tissues in the body, such as the ligaments, joints, and fascia.<br><br>
                    In Yin Yoga, poses are held for anywhere from 1 to 10 minutes, depending on the
                    practitioner's comfort level and experience. The long holds allow for a deeper release and stretch,
                    which can help to increase flexibility, improve joint mobility, and reduce stiffness and pain in the
                    body.<br><br>Overall, Yin Yoga can be a great complement to more active styles of yoga or other
                    forms of exercise, as it provides a balance of deep stretching and relaxation. It can be a wonderful
                    way to unwind, connect with the body, and cultivate a greater sense of inner calm and well-being.
